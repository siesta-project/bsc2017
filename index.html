    <h2>Account setup</h2>
    <pre>
      Login details have been provided in the course.
      Once you have made the initial setup, you can
      run the command 'tutorial_update' at any time
      to update the course files.
    </pre>

    <h2>Graphics terminals</h2>
    <pre>
      If you are using a UNIX-derived system (Linux, MacOS),
      it is quite convenient (and sometimes necessary to avoid
      problems) to do the following:
      
      1. cd $HOME/.ssh 
      2. (Edit the file named 'config' with your favorite editor,
      to add the following stanza (with your number instead of 116 !):

      #-------------
      Host s116
      HostName nord1.bsc.es
      User nct01116
      Protocol 2
      ForwardX11 true
      ForwardX11Trusted true
      #-------------

      Afterwards you can just do:

      ssh s116

      to connect to your account, and to properly forward
      the graphics data.

    <li><h2>Fix for OpenGL support in the Mac's X11 server</h2>
      <pre>
	Some versions of the XQuartz programs in the Mac exhibit
	an obscure bug that prevents the VESTA and XCrysden programs
	to work when executed in the School's computers with a
	remote display on the Mac.

	The fix is to issue this command at the Mac's terminal:

	defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 enable_iglx -bool true
